# EquiProfile Deployment Notes

## Production Deployment Commands

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Build Application
```bash
pnpm run build
```

Expected output:
- `dist/index.js` - Server bundle (~179KB)
- `dist/public/` - Client assets
- Build should complete in ~20-25 seconds

### 3. Restart Service
```bash
sudo systemctl restart equiprofile
```

### 4. Verify Health
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status equiprofile

# Test health endpoint
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","version":"1.0.0","services":{"database":true,"stripe":false,"oauth":false}}
```

### 5. Verify Nginx Proxy
```bash
# Test through Nginx
curl -I https://equiprofile.online/

# Should return 200 OK with proper headers
```

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in `/home/equiprofile/.env`:

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL="mysql://..."
JWT_SECRET="..."
ADMIN_UNLOCK_PASSWORD="..."

# Optional but recommended
ENABLE_STRIPE=true
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_..."
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
ENABLE_UPLOADS=true
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
AWS_S3_BUCKET="..."

# Server config
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
HOST=127.0.0.1
```

## Key Changes in This Release

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules dist
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

### Server Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u equiprofile -n 50

# Common issues:
# - Missing environment variables
